To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install markitdown`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: `pip install -e .`

## Usage

### Command-Line

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md
```

You can also pipe content:

```bash
cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown
```

### Python API

Basic usage in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown()
result = md.convert("test.xlsx")
print(result.text_content)
```

To use Large Language Models for image descriptions, provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model="gpt-4o")
result = md.convert("example.jpg")
print(result.text_content)
```
